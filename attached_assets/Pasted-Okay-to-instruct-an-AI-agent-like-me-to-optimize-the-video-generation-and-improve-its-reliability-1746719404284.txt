Okay, to instruct an AI agent (like me) to optimize the video generation and improve its reliability, you need a prompt that is specific about the areas to address and the desired outcomes.

Here's a refined prompt focusing on those goals:

Prompt for AI Agent:

"Please optimize the scene video generation feature in the joshuwaifo-cannes-demo project, focusing on improving reliability and ensuring successful video generation. Modify the relevant files (server/services/replicate-service.ts, client/src/pages/ScriptEditor.tsx, and potentially server/routes.ts) to implement the following:

Refine Video Generation Prompt (in replicate-service.ts):

Analyze the current videoPrompt construction within the generateVideoFromVariation function.

Enhance the prompt sent to the Replicate Kling model (05e14715e46e46b5c9bf97a382564060130a101307a9509a55e6f6c705060553) for better results and reliability. Consider:

Clarity: Make the instructions for animation (subtle motion, realism, product integration) clearer.

Specificity: Add details that might help the model, perhaps referencing camera movement subtly (e.g., "gentle dolly in") if appropriate for the scene context.

Negative Prompts (if supported/needed): Add instructions on what not to do (e.g., "avoid jerky motion", "do not drastically change the scene composition").

Consistency: Ensure the video prompt strongly relates to the context provided by the still image prompt (createProductPlacementPrompt).

Parameter Tuning: Consult the Replicate documentation for the Kling model. Are there parameters like motion_level, fps, guidance_scale, or seed that can be tuned for better consistency or success rate? Implement sensible defaults or ways to potentially adjust these.

Improve Error Handling & Resilience:

Backend (replicate-service.ts, routes.ts):

In generateVideoFromVariation and getPredictionStatus, implement more specific error catching for Replicate API calls (e.g., rate limits, invalid input errors, model failures).

Propagate meaningful error messages from Replicate (or simplified versions) back to the frontend instead of generic messages.

Ensure the backend logs detailed error information from Replicate, including prediction.error and prediction.logs when available, especially on failure.

Frontend (ScriptEditor.tsx):

Display more informative error messages to the user based on the feedback from the backend.

Make the polling logic (pollPredictionStatus) more resilient to temporary network errors. Consider adding a limited number of retries with exponential backoff within the polling check itself if a single poll request fails network-wise (but stop if the prediction status is 'failed').

Ensure polling intervals (pollingIntervals.current) are reliably cleared when a prediction completes (succeeded/failed/canceled) or when the component unmounts or the active scene changes.

Input Validation (replicate-service.ts or routes.ts):

Before calling replicate.predictions.create in generateVideoFromVariation, add a check to ensure variation.imageUrl is a valid and accessible URL. If not, immediately fail the process with a clear error message, preventing the Replicate call.

Robust State Management (ScriptEditor.tsx):

Double-check the logic for updating videoGenerationStates. Ensure that updates correctly associate status, errors, and URLs with the correct variationId and predictionId, especially handling race conditions if the user quickly switches scenes or triggers multiple generations.

Ensure the 'failed' state clearly displays the error received from the backend.

Implement these changes, ensuring the code remains clean, well-commented, and handles potential edge cases gracefully."
