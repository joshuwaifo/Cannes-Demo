// AI-Enhanced Actor Suggestion Workflow Refactor

/*
Overview:
You are to refactor the Character Casting Suggestions workflow into a modular pipeline
using specialized AI agents and cached inference. The script parsing, genre prediction,
role analysis, and actor suggestion must happen as separate agents working in parallel
and sequenced only where necessary.

Keep the existing Gemini AI logic, model version, and selection result rendering logic intact.
Do not suggest actors until "Find Actors" is clicked.
*/

// -----------------------------
// TASK 1: Character Extraction Agent
// -----------------------------
/*
- Extract all character names from the uploaded script using an AI agent named `extraction agent`
- Populate the dropdown for character selection with these names
- Run this immediately after file upload completes
*/

// -----------------------------
// TASK 2: Genre Prediction Agent
// -----------------------------
/*
- Use another AI agent (`genre agent`) to predict the genre of the uploaded script
- Populate the genre dropdown with the predicted genre
- The dropdown must remain editable so the user can select a different genre if needed
*/

// -----------------------------
// TASK 3: Character Role Pre-fill (description agent)
// -----------------------------
/*
- When a user selects a character, run an AI agent (`description agent`) to estimate:
  - Role Type (e.g., Lead, Supporting)
  - Estimated Age (as integer)
  - Gender
  - Budget Tier
- Use this information to prefill the right-hand search criteria inputs
- Store the output in an in-memory cache (e.g., Map) for later use
*/

// -----------------------------
// TASK 4: Summary Agent
// -----------------------------
/*
- Still on character selection, in parallel with description agent,
  use `summary agent` to generate a concise summary of the character
- Store this summary in the same cache (keyed by character name)
- This will be used later in actor ranking
*/

// -----------------------------
// TASK 5: Actor Database Filtering
// -----------------------------
/*
- When the user clicks "Find Actors", filter actors from the existing database
  based on the filled search criteria (role type, gender, age range, budget tier)
- Do not call any AI model here; use pure logic-based filtering
*/

// -----------------------------
// TASK 6: Selection Agent Ranking
// -----------------------------
/*
- After getting matched actor names, pass them along with the character summary
  to the AI agent `selection agent`
- Ask the agent to return the top 3 actors and include a justification for each
- Display them using the existing logic for actor suggestions
*/

// -----------------------------
// TASK 7: Final Integration
// -----------------------------
/*
- Ensure that actor suggestions only occur when "Find Actors" is clicked
- Retain all the styling, selection, and summary update logic
- The AI calls must exclusively use the existing Gemini import and MODEL_NAME
