Total Budget [included in script editor -> optimize funding]
Progress bar/bar graph:
% Budget met by potential sponsorship opportunities 
Which sponsors/brands and the images and videos to export
% Budget met by filming location grants/incentives/tax breaks
Which filming location and perhaps link to the program details (website?)
Graphical breakdown of the budget needs; as shared in whatsapp: we have a pie chart which shows the total budget = whole pie; one slice is the brand sponsorship $, one slice is the filming location $, and one slice (remainder of the pie) is 'external capital requirements'

	The Filming Locations/Incentives tool is great already! @Shannon: This is moving exactly towards what we discussed this week! Great! - In the further course of the project, let’s ramp this up, including. e.g., data visualisation (potential) budget distributions. It would also be great to be able to enter some (potential) budget corner posts and to create a first budget breakdown right away. Also, let’s collect more data on the respective incentives and ways to receive grants to present more information on this right away. @Christian & @Shannon: We should also discuss how VADIS could offer services and products right away.

	The “Casting Suggestions” is a great basic function to go further from … It does not work as is to support our intended purpose for a couple of reasons, as casting isn’t simply a “wish list” thing, but part of a more complex process with decisions resulting from various inputs. However, if we get it right, there is a lot of potential to create a long overdue market leader in this field as well. As IMDB hasn’t truly innovated on a pro level for a while … There is a lot to get out of this for VADIS with relatively small future effort. @Shannon - we discussed this briefly last week already. @CJ - we should discuss between the 3 of us in Cannes. I recommend we have a chat about the details in Cannes and call our current version a demo for now.
